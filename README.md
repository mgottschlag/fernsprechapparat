# Fernsprechapparat

This application implements SIP support for modded old telephones with rotary
dials.

The program is intended for a mod of a FeTAp (Fernsprechtischapparat) of the
Deutsche Bundespost, but will likely work with any similar phones. The rotary
dial, hook switch, and bell are supposed to be connected via GPIOs exposed by
sysfs.
